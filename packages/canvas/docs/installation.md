# Installation

NativeScript Canvas brings the Skia Graphics Library to NativeScript. It offers all the power that native canvas provides for all flavors that run on NativeScript (JS, TS, Angular, Vue, Svelte, React...). 

This library is not a webview, it uses native components.

## Installation



```bash
npm i @nativescript/canvas
```
